# This project is for benchmarking of multiple streaming tools base on python 
# The goal is to compare spark, flink,native python for streaming preprocessing 
# and learning step 
We will do this in 3 steps : 

1. Data Acquisition

We will fetch data from twitter and put it in kafka 

Ref : https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries.html

2. Data Pre processing 

At this step we will use all text mining methods for cleaning data 

3. Learning 

We will deploy deep learning model for machine translation
